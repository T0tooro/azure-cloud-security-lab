# Azure Cloud Security Lab

## 🎯 Project Overview
A hands-on learning project to develop practical cloud security engineering skills by building a secure multi-tier infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform
- Virtual Networks (VNet) & Subnets
- Network Security Groups (NSG)
- Azure Bastion
- Azure Monitor & Logging
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## 📋 Project Goals
- Understand cloud security architecture
- Implement defense-in-depth security strategy
- Practice network segmentation
- Configure security monitoring and alerts
- Gain hands-on Azure experience
